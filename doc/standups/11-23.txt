Name: Hangyu Zhu

What have you done since yesterday?
	- Create Account, Student, Admin, StudentAccount, AdminAccount, Course, AllCourses classes

What are you planning on doing today?
  - Create a Firebase Realtime Database
	- Write methods to interact with the database (e.g. a method that allows admins to add courses to the database)
  - Refactor the code I wrote yesterday

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- Unfamiliar with using Android Studio, GitHub, Jira, Firebase Realtime Database
  - It seems like I chose the wrong approach to address my user stories yesterday (it makes more sense to store all courses in the realtime database, instead of storing them in the AllCourses class)
