What have you done since yesterday?
	- worked on the tabbed fragment using ViewPager

What are you planning on doing today?
	- apparently ViewPager is deprecated. I wanna find out if I can make it work with ViewPager2

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- other course work
  - it seems I am confused about fragments vs activities
