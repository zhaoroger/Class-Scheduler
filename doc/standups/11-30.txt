What have you done since yesterday?
	- Attempt to test my code

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Debug getAllCourses method (keeps returning an empty list)

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- I can’t figure out how to run a Driver.java file to test my work. I do not have an Android project to run in Android Studio, and I cannot compile my code in other IDEs because they don’t support Firebase.
