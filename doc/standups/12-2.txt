What have you done since yesterday?
	- Integrate my code with the Admin module

What are you planning on doing today?
	- Figure out why I can’t connect to Firebase

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- As of today I can no longer read or write data to Firebase. My code is correct, the project is connected to Firebase, read/write permissions are set up correctly, and I have not changed any settings. I’m not sure why my code suddenly stopped working.

What have you done since yesterday?
	- debugging my code

What are you planning on doing today?
	- continue trying to make my module write users into the database

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- my code is buggier than I thought and it's taking a lot of time to sort them out before I can move on to the next task
